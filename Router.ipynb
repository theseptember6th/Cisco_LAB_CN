    "Great! Since you're new to **computer networking**, let's go step-by-step and understand **everything in-depth** based on the YouTube video you shared. The video demonstrates **how routers work in Cisco Packet Tracer** to connect two different IP networks. Here's a deep explanation broken into simple parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 **What is a Router?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **router** is a device that connects **two or more different networks** together. Its job is to **route (forward)** data from one network to another. It operates mainly at **Layer 3 (Network layer)** of the OSI model and uses **IP addresses** to determine where to send data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📘 **Scenario in the Video**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Two switches**\n",
    "* Each switch connects to a few PCs.\n",
    "* But these PCs are in **different IP address ranges (subnets)**, so they can't talk to each other **directly**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, we add a **router** between them so they can communicate even though they're on **different networks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ **What Happens in Cisco Packet Tracer?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s walk through everything shown in the video.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ Step 1: Add the Router\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **1941 router** is added to the workspace.\n",
    "* Originally, **switch 0** and **switch 1** were connected directly to each other.\n",
    "* That connection is removed.\n",
    "* Now:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Switch 0 is connected to **GigabitEthernet0/0** of the router.\n",
    "  * Switch 1 is connected to **GigabitEthernet0/1** of the router.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 **Important**: Routers usually use **GigabitEthernet** ports, while switches often use **FastEthernet**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧾 Step 2: Set IP Addresses on PCs\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assign IP addresses to PCs in **different networks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Switch 0** PCs:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * PC0: `192.168.1.10`\n",
    "  * PC1: `192.168.1.11`\n",
    "  * Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`\n",
    "  * Default Gateway: `192.168.1.1` (This is the IP we will set on the router interface connected to Switch 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Switch 1** PCs:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * PC2: `172.16.1.10`\n",
    "  * PC3: `172.16.1.11`\n",
    "  * Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`\n",
    "  * Default Gateway: `172.16.1.1` (This is the IP we will set on the router interface connected to Switch 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🖥️ Step 3: Configure Router Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Go into the router configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interface GigabitEthernet0/0**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * IP Address: `192.168.1.1`\n",
    "  * Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`\n",
    "  * This connects to Switch 0\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interface GigabitEthernet0/1**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * IP Address: `172.16.1.1`\n",
    "  * Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`\n",
    "  * This connects to Switch 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Make sure to set the interfaces to `ON` or `UP`** by enabling the port status. If the interface is down, no communication will happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📶 Step 4: Set the Default Gateway on Each PC\n",
    "\n",
    "Each PC must know **where to send data** when the destination is **outside its own network**. That’s what the **default gateway** is for.\n",
    "\n",
    "* PCs in `192.168.1.x` use gateway `192.168.1.1`\n",
    "* PCs in `172.16.1.x` use gateway `172.16.1.1`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📡 Step 5: Test the Network (Ping Test)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the `ping` command from one PC to another in the **other network** to check if communication works.\n",
    "* The first ping might fail (timeout) because the router needs time to learn where to forward the packets (ARP process).\n",
    "* After that, pings should succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 What’s Happening Behind the Scenes?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **PC sends packet** → to a destination IP (like 172.16.1.10).\n",
    "2. It sees that destination is **outside** its own network.\n",
    "3. So it sends the packet to the **default gateway (router)**.\n",
    "4. Router receives it on one interface and **routes** it to the correct interface.\n",
    "5. Packet reaches the **destination PC**.\n",
    "6. Reply follows the same path **back to the source PC**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 Bonus: How Switch and Router Work Together?\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **switch** just connects devices in the **same network**.\n",
    "* The **router** connects devices in **different networks**.\n",
    "* Switches use **MAC addresses**.\n",
    "* Routers use **IP addresses**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Why Can’t You Just Use a Switch Alone?\n",
    "\n",
    "Switches work in **one network**. But if two PCs are in **different subnets**, switches can't **route** the traffic. That’s why we need a **router**.\n",

    "We used `172.16.1.1` as the **IP address for the router’s interface** because:\n",
